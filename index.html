  <h1>Women In State Legislature<br /> 1975-2015</h1>
  <p>Since 1969, the number of women serving in state legislatures has increased substantially from several hundred to 1,814 (24.6 percent of the 7383 seats) as of 2015. Approximately 60 percent of female legislators are Democrats, but Republican women have been closing the gap in recent elections. The chart below orders states by how many women have served on average since 1975. Though New Hampshire has had more women serve in legislature on average, women made up 42 percent of the legislature in Colorado during 2015.</p>
